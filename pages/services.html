                    <p class="ml-4">For most of us, pets are part of the family, so when a beloved four-legged friend
                        suffers an
                        illness or injury, it is upsetting and, very often, extremely expensive.<br>

                        Vet bills can make a significant dent in your finances, so it’s worth planning for unexpected
                        costs so you’re covered if your pet needs medical treatment.</p><br>

                    <h3>- There are four types of pet insurance:</h3>
                    <p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Lifetime policies : also known as lifelong, cover for life, reinstatement, repopulating

                            </li>

                                2-A set time period for which treatment of each illness or injury will be covered.
                                Policies will typically cover the cost of treating your pet for a particular illness or
                                injury for 12 months from the start of that illness or injury (as long as the policy
                                remains in force). The time-limit does not relate to the duration of the policy, but to
                                the maximum amount of time an illness or injury is covered for.

                                apply the limits to all occurrences of an illness or injury. For example, if the same
                                illness happens in the other leg, eye or ear and the 12 month period for the first
                                episode of the illness has ended or the sum of money available been used, your pet will
                                not be covered for this further episode . Insurers see these as recurring conditions
                                related to the previous episode so will treat as one condition, for the duration of the
                                policy.

                                pet bed, having a kennel can give your pet a place to retreat and feel secure. Crate
                                training is an integral part of housebreaking and can also play a role in other types of
                                training. Additionally, kennels can really come in handy for travel.</p>

                                your pets development. Playing with toys often mimics the activities dogs would perform

                        healthy weight and heart, while increasing muscle mass. Your dog’s exercise requirements will be
                        different depending on breed, sex, age, and health.</p>

                    <p>Lack of exercise and overfeeding is as much a problem in pets as it is in people. Your dog cannot
                        decide how much exercise he or she needs or what kind of food is best to eat; only you can do
                        that. Arthritis, liver disease, and coronary disease are just a few of the health issues facing
                        an overweight dog. To help your dog lose weight, your vet may recommend a mix of exercise and
                        switching to a low-calorie brand of food, or gradually reducing the amount of regular food you
                        feed your dog. If your pup is overweight talk to your vet to figure out the best course of
                        action.</p>

                    <h3 id="cats">- Cats :</h3><br>
                    <p>Having a cat can mean different things to different people. Some want a cat to cuddle and sit on
                        their laps; others are happy to live with a very independent cat which spends most of its time
                        outside and doesn’t want too much human interaction.

                        What is important is that you try to find a cat that will interact with you if you want it to.
                        All cats are not the same and how each individual cat behaves with you can depend on its
                        inherent personality and early experiences (or lack of experiences), which can make it fearful
                        or confident with people and life in general.

                        The environment in which you keep a cat is also extremely significant – for example if it lives
                        with many other cats which do not get on, then it will be stressed and will react differently
                        than if it was on its own.

                        While there is no guaranteed way to choose the perfect cat for you and your lifestyle,
                        understanding your expectations as well as what makes cats tick will help you to bring home a
                        cat that should be able to cope with its new environment and be the pet that you want too.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="col-md-8">
                    <p>As pets go, cats are relatively low maintenance compared to dogs which need companionship,
                        walking, training etc. However, like any pet, they do need care, and some cats need more care
                        than others. Do you want to spend a lot of time with your cat, do you want it to be demanding,
                        or do you have limited time? Cats can fit into busy, modern lifestyles more easily than dogs, as
                        they are pretty independent, can be left alone much more easily and are more suitable for
                        smaller flats or houses. Cats are often chosen by people who have busy and stressful lifestyles
                        and who want some companionship when they go home to relax.</p>

                    <p> What do you want from your relationship with a cat? If you’re the kind of person who really
                        needs to have a close relationship with your cat and to be able to handle it and have it
                        interact with you, then you’ll be disappointed if you take on a nervous cat that hides every
                        time you come into the room. You may want to think about one of the pedigree breeds which can be
                        more interactive and perhaps more needy of human company than some moggies. This may however
                        become a problem for the cat if you are out at work all day and only available to give attention
                        on evenings or weekends.</p>
                    <p> Some cats need to know exactly what’s going to happen when, in order to feel relaxed. Such cats
                        would be quite happy living with an old lady who rarely has visitors and leads a very quiet
                        life, but would probably find it quite stressful living in a home full of kids and other animals
                        with lots of visitors and activity. Other cats, however, might thrive on different interactions
                        with lots of people and fit in perfectly well in a busy household.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="col-12">
                    <p> If you’re not likely to have the time or inclination to groom a cat on a daily basis, don’t even
                        think of getting a Persian or a cat with a long coat. In pedigree jargon, any cat with a longer
                        coat, aside from a Persian, is called semi-longhaired because the coat is not as full as the
                        Persian’s and does not have such a thick undercoat; however, it is still long and requires
                        grooming. In addition, if you are extremely house-proud, you may not want lots of hair
                        everywhere.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A shorthaired cat is a much easier option, as most cats are fanatical about their coats and keep
                        them in immaculate condition. That’s not to say that they don’t leave hairs around – bear this
                        in mind if you’re thinking of getting a white cat but have dark furniture, or vice versa.
                        Likewise, a cat is quite likely to sharpen its claws indoors, often on the stair carpet,
                        sometimes on the furniture or even on the wallpaper. Whether your cat does this can depend on
                        the cat itself and also the environment you provide for it; however there are things you can do
                        to try and deal with this, but it is best to acknowledge from the outset that your cat is an
                        animal with free will and natural behaviour that may not suit someone who needs to have an
                        immaculate house.</p>

                        foremost, and looks and behaves as it does for just this reason. A cat is what is called an
                        obligate carnivore – it has an absolute need for some of the nutrients found in meat and all of
                        its senses of smell and taste are atuned to being a carnivore – it would be unfair and very
                        dangerous to health to even attempt keeping it as a vegetarian.</p>

                    <p>You may have a great aversion to your cat hunting outside. Perhaps you are a bird lover, or are
                        simply unable to deal with small carcases on the floor. Hunting is normal behaviour for cats.
                        Keeping a cat indoors may prevent it actually killing anything, but it will still need an outlet
                        for this, its most instinctive behaviour, and not all cats will be happy with an indoor
                        lifestyle. Likewise, if you’re simply getting a cat to keep vermin at bay, you won’t want to
                        find yourself with one which isn’t especially interested in huntin’, shootin’ and fishin’ and
                        prefers being a couch potato! Older cats are likely to hunt much less than younger ones and some
                        cats don’t bother at all, but there is no easy way to know how a cat will behave.</p>

                        outdoors brings a huge variety to its life and allows it to use all of its hunting behaviours if
                        it wants to. Of course, there are risks outside for cats, but you need to balance these with the
                        very positive aspects of physical and mental stimulation and an outlet for natural behaviour.

                    <p>There is no reason not to have a cat or kitten if you have children. It is up to parents to teach
                        their children from the very beginning how to approach, stroke and handle cats and to treat them
                        kindly. Many children have fantastic relationships with their cats and learn about respecting
                        other creatures and being gentle – it is done successfully all the time, but it is up to parents
                        to lay down the rules. Perhaps taking on a new kitten when you have a new baby or a toddler
                        might be a lot to handle at once, so ensuring you have time for all the parties is part of a
                        successful relationship. Likewise, if you are pregnant there is no need to get rid of the cat.
                        Simple and basic hygiene precautions and common sense management of the cat, while the baby is
                        small, can ensure all cohabit happily and safely.</p>

                        its character. However, kittens require a lot of attention and some forethought to prevent them

                    <p>The sex of a kitten doesn’t really matter, as long as you neuter your kitten before it reaches
                        puberty (at about four months of age) when the influence of sex hormones kick in. Un-neutered
                        cats may exhibit unwelcome reproductive behaviours. For example, un-neutered male cats will mark
                        their territory with strong smelling urine while un-neutered female cats can come into season
                        every two weeks if they do not become pregnant.

                        If you are getting just one cat or kitten, it doesn’t matter which sex you choose. Equally, if
                        you want two kittens and you are getting two from the same litter, the sex of either cat is
                        probably not important. However, if you have a resident cat and are getting just one kitten or
                        another cat, it may be worth considering going for one of the opposite sex to try and remove
                        some of the competition factor. A kitten may be a better option than another adult cat in such
                        cases as the young cat’s immaturity seems to remove this competition factor – for a while anyway
                        during which time you hope they will get to like each other! Neutering also removes the need for
                        so much competition and makes the choice of sex much less important.</p>

                    <p>The majority of cats kept as pets are what we call moggies or domestic short or long haired cats
                        – that is they are a random mixture of lots of different cats, we have often have little idea
                        about their parentage (well the father anyway). This means we have no control over the colour,
                        body shape, coat length or anything else that the kittens can inherit from their parents. So,
                        for example, if your kitten is from a moggie mum but its father is unknown, it may develop a
                        longer coat than you desire if the father was indeed longhaired.

                        There is more to choosing a pedigree cat than just liking a certain coat colour or length –
                        there are ethical considerations with some breeds if you really want to consider the cat’s
                        welfare. There are also health issues which you need to check with the breeder and things you
                        need to ask. Good breeders aim to breed healthy, people-friendly cats and avoid (or seek to deal
                        with) inherited disorders which arise.</p>

                    <p>Having a bird as a pet means enjoying one more member at home. There are many benefits to having
                        a bird at your side, but it also requires some sacrifice. A pet is not a toy. It requires care,
                        care, and even having permits in order in some cases.

                        Choosing the right species is fundamental. Each bird has its peculiarities, and therefore, it is
                        necessary to get to know them carefully before acquiring them. Keep in mind that it is not the
                        same to take care of a lovebird than a parrot or a peacock.

                        Therefore, in this post, we have collected some tips when choosing the most appropriate bird, so
                        you will have a good companion and your bird a good caregiver.</p>

                        Your house’s infrastructure is decisive. It must be appropriate according to the size and needs
                        of your bird. It doesn´t have to only about the cage, but space you have in the rest of your
                        house.

                        For example, if you want a duck or peacock, it would be great to have a large outdoor garden
                        with a pond or drinker because they are birds that like to have the freedom to move.

                        However, if your house is small, you better buy a Goldfinch, canary or other similar birds. With
                        a small cage, a suitable temperature and a feeder, you will satisfy its basic accommodation
                        needs.

                    <p>Even if you’re willing to have a bird as a pet, you should keep this point in mind. Coexistence

                        this option or try to achieve an agreement. In the end, the worst victim could be your bird
                        which is not guilty.

                        Having at home small children or people allergic to animals can be a harmful detonating. Make
                        sure that the arrival of the pet does not involve physical harm to itself or the members of your

                    <p>The prices of birds may vary according to the species like some cats and dogs. If you track
                        animal sales portals, you will find very disparate rates. While a parakeet can be over 10-15
                        euros average, a parrot Macaw exceeds 1000 euros in many cases.

                        Exotic birds are the most expensive both when acquiring and maintaining them. The average can
                        usually be over 100-150 euros per month. These expenses are for buying food, toys, cage and
                        other supplies.

                        A lot of people think that just because they are small animals, the expenses are reduced.
                        However, it is better to have the calculator on hand and to value the bird that best fits your

                    <p>Certainly, you need to feed your fish, but it’s important that you don’t overfeed. Sprinkle with
                        a light hand, and if your fish are leaving food floating, chances are good that you’re feeding
                        too much. It’s a good idea to vary the diet so it includes food of several different types,
                        including flakes, pellets, fresh and freeze-dried foods..

                        </ul>
                        Every week or every other week, take soap and water and wipe down the entire habitat once it’s
                        empty of bedding, toys, and other pieces. That extra step will keep your hammie’s space smelling
                        good.

                        accidentally escape from or slip through your hands. Because these pets are naturally nocturnal,
                        be sensitive to the time of day you are trying to handle your hammie. You wouldn’t want someone

                    <p>Turtles are fascinating to watch, and many have attractive colors and markings, and interesting
                        personalities. They can make great interactive pets. They are known for recognizing their owners
                        and endlessly begging for food. It’s all part of their charm. <br>

                        However, a lot of work is involved in keeping a turtle. They are not like dogs and cats. Turtles
                        don’t enjoy being handled. They can easily live up to 20 or 30 years, and providing them with
                        the proper enclosure as they grow can be a larger investment than you initially expected. By
                        purchasing a turtle, you are making a commitment to their care — and doing so for the long haul.

                <div class="col-md-8">
                    <p>
                        As far as housing goes, bigger is better. Many aquatic turtles are active swimmers, so choose
                        the largest size enclosure possible. Glass aquaria are a popular choice. A 30-gallon tank is the
                        absolute minimum size for smaller species measuring between 4 and 6 inches. For turtles between
                        6 and 8 inches, a 55-gallon tank is appropriate. And for turtles measuring more than 8 inches,
                        tanks in the 75- to 125-gallon range are a better choice. If you start with a younger, smaller
                        turtle, a smaller tank is acceptable as long as the enclosure size increases as your turtle
                        grows. <br>
                        Other turtle housing choices include plastic tubs available at most home or hardware stores.
                        Some tubs with both a water and land area are even designed specifically for turtles. If you
                        have the room, another great option is an indoor or outdoor pond.

                        One secret to successful turtlekeeping is clean water. A good filtration system goes a long way
                        in accomplishing this. Two excellent choices for turtle tanks are an internal aquarium filter or
                        a canister filter. Whichever you choose, make sure you regularly maintain the filter. Turtles
                        are really messy. <br>

                        Keep tank decorations to a minimum. Most turtles destroy any attempts at aquascaping. Substrate
                        in a turtle tank only accumulates uneaten food and waste, which quickly fouls the water, yet
                        some turtle species, such as soft-shell turtles, which need a soft sand bottom, require it.
                        However, for most turtles I don’t use any substrate or gravel, making cleaning much easier. On
                        the other hand, if a bare-looking tank is not aesthetically appealing to you, feel free to
                        decorate it, but be prepared for more difficult and more frequent cleaning. <br>

                        One piece of décor is essential to most turtle habitats: a basking spot. This can be a carefully
                        placed rock, a piece of driftwood or one of the ready-made basking platforms available at local
                        pet stores. I highly recommend above-tank basking platforms for most aquatic turtles. Whatever
                        type of basking spot you pick, select one large enough to allow the turtle to climb out of the
                        water completely, and place it securely under the basking light.

                <div class="col-md-8">
                    <p>An important aspect of turtle care often neglected or misunderstood is lighting. Turtles reap
                        two primary benefits from light: ultraviolet light and heat.
                        <br>
                        Two types of ultraviolet light, UVA and UVB, are essential for your turtle’s health. UVA light
                        seems to encourage natural behavior such as feeding and reproduction. Turtles require UVB for
                        the synthesis of vitamin D3, which in turn allows calcium absorption and metabolism. Correct UVB
                        exposure is also necessary for a turtle’s growth. Without it, there is potential for serious
                        health issues such as poor shell growth, secondary hyperparathyroidism and a shorter life span.
                        <br>

                        Turtles also get heat from light. Like all reptiles, turtles are ectotherms, so they need
                        different temperature zones to regulate body temperature. A good general rule is to maintain a
                        basking spot within the range of 85 to 95 degrees Fahrenheit. The water temperature should
                        average about 10 to 15 degrees lower than the basking spot, and you can attain it with a
                        submersible aquarium heater.
                        <br>

                        Many styles of bulbs and light systems are available. Whichever you choose, make sure it takes
                        care of your turtle’s UV and heat requirements. Not all turtles have the same needs, so research
                        the specific needs of any turtles you wish to keep.</p>

                        Whenever possible, buy captive-bred turtles. They are already adapted to captivity, there is
                        less of a chance for disease or parasites, and they are accustomed to commercial turtle foods.
                        Whether purchasing your turtle from a local pet store, breeder or online, ask whether they are
                        captive bred or wild caught. Another option is to adopt from a local turtle rescue organization.

                        Please don’t collect animals from the wild. Many states restrict wild collections, and many
                        turtle species are threatened or endangered, making them illegal to collect.
                        <br>

                        Please don’t release unwanted turtles into the wild. Doing so could cause major environmental
                        problems. In addition, your turtle may not be equipped to handle the local environmental
                        conditions, so you could be sending it to its death.

                    <p>When it comes to raising a healthy turtle, prevention is the best medicine. A well-balanced diet
                        is a key to success. Offer as many different foods as possible with a quality turtle food as the
                        diet staple. Keep in mind a turtle’s dietary needs change as it matures. Although many are
                        primarily carnivorous as hatchlings, they consume more plant matter as they reach adulthood. For
                        some adult turtles, plant matter may even make up the majority of their diet.<br>
                        In addition to turtle pellets, many frozen and freeze-dried foods are available, including
                        krill, crickets, grasshoppers and snails. Turtles also readily accept live foods such as
                        insects, worms, snails and small fish. These can be gut-loaded or dusted with calcium for added
                        benefit. I also encourage the use of cuttlebone as an additional source of calcium for your
                        turtle.<br>

                        For greens, turtles enjoy dandelion leaves, and green- and red-leaf lettuce. Aquatic plants
                        available at the local pet store such as anacharis, water lettuce and water hyacinth are also
                        good additions. Avoid iceberg lettuce, however, because it doesn’t have any real nutritional
                        value. Other foods to avoid are spinach, mushrooms and cabbage. In general, I would not
                        recommend fruits either.

                <div class="col-md-8">
                    <p>Not all turtles are appropriate for beginners. Some have special needs, such as dietary
                        restrictions or large habitat requirements. However, many turtles make great first pets.
                        <br>
                        Painted Turtles: As is indicated by their namesake, painted turtles (Chrysemys picta) are very
                        attractive. There are four recognized subspecies: eastern painted turtles (C. p. picta),
                        southern painted turtles (C. p. dorsalis), western painted turtles (C. p. bellii) and midland
                        painted turtles (C. p. marginata). With the exception of C. p. marginata, which can grow up to
                        10 inches, these turtles remain between 5 to 7 inches, making them an excellent choice for
                        novice turtlekeepers.
                        <br>

                        Painted turtles are big baskers, so a basking spot is a must. Most are fairly active swimmers,
                        so provide a water area large and deep enough for them to swim. In my experience they have
                        always proven to be robust eaters. Like many other turtles, they are omnivorous with their diet
                        consisting of more plant matter as they mature.
                        <br>

                        These turtles truly have everything you could ask for in a turtle: a relatively small size,
                        beautiful colors, a hearty appetite, ease of care and a rather pleasant nature.
                        <br>

                        Sliders and Cooters: One could make the argument that sliders (Trachemys scripta) and cooters
                        (Pseudemys spp.) don’t make good beginner turtles. The main reason is their adult size; some
                        females can measure 16 to 18 inches. For this reason alone, you might be better off selecting a
                        different family of turtles unless, of course, you can provide a large enough enclosure. A
                        75-gallon tank is considered the minimum size to house one of the smaller turtles in this
                        family. A 125-gallon tank or larger is required for some of the bigger species.
                        <br>

                        Yet sliders and cooters can make great pets. Hardy, they adapt well to captivity, eagerly accept
                        all foods and have attractive markings and colors. These turtles are big baskers and appreciate
                        deeper water, especially as they grow. Primarily carnivorous as hatchlings, many adults shift
                        their diets to more plant matter.
                        <br>

                        One personal favorite is the yellow-bellied slider (Trachemys scripta scripta). They tend to
                        range between 5 and 12 inches, and they have attractive yellow coloring.

                    <img src="../images/ourservices/turtles/pic6.jpg" height="300" class="img-fluid" alt="">

                <div class="col-md-8">
                    <p> Regardless of whether they make a good pet, any turtle that grows too large for the housing you
                        are able to provide is a turtle you should avoid.
                        <br>

                        A classic example is the snapping turtle. All too often available as cute little hatchlings,
                        they just grow too large and bulky for the average turtlekeeper. They are relatively easy to
                        maintain, but their rapid growth and rather nasty disposition make them better fare for zoos and
                        aquariums.
                        <br>

                        Soft-shell turtles also are not recommend for most turtlekeepers. These aggressive turtles can
                        grow very large, and they can inflict a serious bite. They also require specialized care. Close
                        attention must be paid to water quality, and the turtles require a soft sand substrate for
                        hiding. If not properly cared for, this substrate can make it harder to maintain the pristine
                        water conditions required. Health problems, including infection, can set in if conditions are
                        not met for this primarily aquatic turtle.

                <div class="col-md-8">
                    <p> Of course, I can’t discuss sliders without mentioning the most popular pet turtle: the red-eared
                        slider (Trachemys scripta elegans). This beautiful turtle is known for the red markings near its
                        eyes. What most people fail to realize, however, is that these turtles can eventually measure a
                        foot long. Due to this fact, red-eared sliders have been the most neglected and abandoned
                        turtle. This even led to Florida placing a ban on them as pets in 2007, but certain color
                        morphs, such as albinos and pastels, are still legal to own and sell. Turtle rescue
                        organizations are swamped with these turtles, and many can’t accept any more because it is just
                        too difficult to find them homes. Please be absolutely sure you can properly house an adult if
                        you’re considering a slider, cooter or any turtle for that matter.
                        <br>
                        Mud and Musk Turtles: Perhaps not as beautiful as some other popular turtles, mud turtles
                        (Kinosternon spp.) and musk turtles (Sternotherus spp.) are certainly high on my
                        easy-to-keep-turtle list. Between these two types of turtles there are many to choose from, and
                        most make great starter turtles. Some examples are eastern mud turtles (Kinosternon s.
                        subrubrum), Mississippi mud turtles (K. s. hippocrepis), striped mud turtles (K. baurii), common
                        musk turtles (Sternotherus odoratus) and striped-neck musk turtles (S. minor peltifer).
                        <br>

                        Many mud and musk turtles remain rather small. Some only grow to 4 or 5 inches, allowing you to
                        house them in a smaller tank. Unlike some other aquatic turtles, mud and musk turtles are not
                        big baskers, but you still must provide a basking spot. They might not use it as frequently as
                        other turtles, but they still need it. Although some believe that mud and musk turtles don’t
                        absolutely need UVB lighting because they are not really a basking turtle, there is certainly no
                        harm in providing it. These turtles prefer to crawl along the bottom rather than swim, so deep
                        water is not required.
                        <br>

                        Mud and musk turtles are carnivorous, but they will attempt to eat just about anything you put
                        in front of them. This includes your fingers, so be careful when feeding them. They can be a
                        little nippy.
                        <br>

                        Map Turtles: In my opinion, map turtles (Graptemys spp.) have some of the most distinct patterns
                        and shells of any turtle. I hesitate, however, in recommending them for novice turtle hobbyists.
                        They’re better off left to intermediate or advanced turtlekeepers, but if you follow some basic
                        guidelines, you can be successful with these turtles.
                        <br>

                        In general, their care is similar to that of sliders and painted turtles. Excellent water
                        quality and a proper diet are the secrets to success with these turtles. Map turtles require
                        clean water, and they seem to be less tolerant of poor water conditions than some other turtles.
                        They also tend to be more prone to infections. Map turtles are omnivorous, but each species’
                        diet varies slightly.
                        <br>

                        I have also found that map turtles tend to be shy, so take care in choosing their habitat’s
                        location. A high-traffic area may stress them; but if they’re given time, they tend to become
                        less nervous around you.

                        necessary for husbandry or health. These concerns should be addressed before a rhythmic pattern
                        of interaction can be established. Keep the three Cs in mind when dealing with any reptile:
                        cool, calm and collected. Here are 13 secrets to facilitate the best possible standard of

                        Herps are in captivity for our enjoyment, and we owe them every ounce of respect we have to make
                        their lives as pleasant as possible. For us this means that if we are not 100 percent
                        comfortable and confident with the animal we are working with, then we should gain the knowledge
                        with a smaller specimen, a less difficult species to maintain, a less aggressive similar
                        species, or work with the species under the supervision of an experienced herpetoculturist.
                        <br>
                        It can also mean starting with reptiles in our budget regarding three key areas: housing,
                        husbandry and acquisition. Always try to buy the best housing and husbandry tools you can afford
                        first and then figure out what animals fit within your budget. Too often the opposite happens,
                        and the animal suffers.<br>

                        If you address these primary points from the start, your reptile will be happier in the long
                        run, and you will be, too. This creates a more positive interaction on a daily basis, which
                        undoubtedly creates a platform for the best possible relationship with your pet. species, or

                    <p>This is key for herpkeepers of all levels. Confidence leads to acute decisions. Acute, confident
                        interaction eliminates fearful jerking of your body, hesitant approaches, and timid assessments
                        of husbandry and health.
                        <br>
                        Body language dictates response. When you are fearful or uncertain, the animal responds in turn.
                        Be certain you are confident with a species before you acquire it. If you’re not, you will not
                        enjoy your pet’s true potential.

                        Some species reputed to be less-than-ideal pets can make exceptional pets if a responsible owner
                        raises them from a hatchling. Reticulated pythons (Python reticulatus) have been labeled as
                        aggressive snakes over the years due to imported animals being fearful and heavily stressed. Yet
                        Jay has several tame retics, including one 20 feet long. Establishing a relationship with a
                        young pet and raising it with care is the best way to have a confident, stable relationship with

                        Snakes and lizards generally bite for one of two reasons: It’s a feeding response, or it’s a
                        defensive strike. Either can be avoided in most cases. Before you pick up a pet snake from its
                        enclosure, respectfully and confidently let the animal know that there is no food involved. This
                        can generally be done by using an inanimate object to gently touch the snake’s nose, or by
                        simply removing the animal from the enclosure with a small hook.<br>

                        “Break the hunt” is a concept you should keep in mind. Most snakes are ambush predators, and if
                        you don’t break the concentration of the hunt, then you are playing the gamble of predator
                        drive.
                        <br>

                        Whenever you use a hook to remove a snake from an enclosure, be certain to support the first
                        third of the snake’s body with the hook while keeping the last two-thirds fully supported with
                        your other arm and hand. This confident approach keeps the snake comfortable. Never grab a snake
                        or lizard by the end of its tail to remove it from its enclosure. This puts serious strain on
                        the animal. Anytime a reptile is not supported it can reinforce a defensive mentality in the
                        animal and invoke fear.

                    <p>Snakes and lizards have amazing sensory organs. If you introduce your warm hand to an enclosure
                        with the sweet scent of a prey item on it, you have done little more than disguise your hand as
                        a prey item. The easiest way to avoid this is by washing your hands before handling reptiles and
                        between handling different species. This also helps to eliminate the risks of introducing
                        foreign bacteria, germs or parasites to your animals.

                        Respect it, be confident, break the hunt, wash your hands and so on, but with newly acquired
                        animals that have shown past aggression (perhaps due to fear), simply keep their heads pointed
                        away from your body.<br>

                        Gently orientating yourself or the reptile away from you slowly allows the animal to become
                        accustomed to the feeling of motion in your hands while reducing the chance of the experience

                        perceive the motions as a threat.

                    <p> A plethora of reptiles and amphibians are available to us in our hobby thanks to the efforts of
                        professional breeders, private breeders and hobbyists. This has created a spectrum of choices
                        for the would-be herp owner. These choices encompass intolerant animals, those tolerant of
                        routine maintenance, those that are relatively tolerant, and the relatively exclusive group of
                        animals outwardly social and interactive.<br>Specimens from nearly every size range overlap into
                        each category. Some of the animals that make excellent household pets are leopard geckos
                        (Eublepharis macularius), bearded dragons (Pogona vitticeps), Argentine black-and-white
                        (Tupinambis merianae) or red tegus (Tupinambis rufescens), corn snakes (Elaphe guttata), ball
                        pythons (Python regius), and rosy boas (Lichanura trivirgata). Some larger animals that make
                        great pets are red-tailed boas (Boa constrictor), Burmese pythons (Python molurus bivittatus)
                        and reticulated pythons.<br>

                        Most frogs, most arboreal geckos, African rock pythons (Python sebae) and Nile monitors (Varanus
                        niloticus) are animals that generally do not adapt to handling as readily and should be kept by
                        more experienced people. Some of these animals may be defensive when young, which can lead to
                        occasional nips. They generally outgrow this defensiveness with calm, confident handling and as
                        they gain in size. As always, carefully research any animal you wish to keep, so you can
                        evaluate whether you can meet an animal’s husbandry needs.

                        temperature is generally much cooler than what most reptiles need to maintain their body
                        temperature. A good general rule of thumb is to limit the pet’s time period out of the cage to
                        less than 30 minutes. Otherwise you may lower the animal’s body temperature too low and
                        potentially risk its health.

                    <p>Whenever allowing a child to pet or hold a reptile, adults have a responsibility to protect both
                        the
                        animal and the child. Rough handling by a child can potentially ruin an animal’s trust of
                        people.
                        Animals of all kinds have the potential to bite and scratch — or tail-whip in the case of some
                        lizards — which can potentially harm children or scar their perception of these ectothermic
                        beauties.

                        Never allow children to remove an animal from its enclosure because this is their greatest
                        chance to
                        receive a feeding-response bite. A secondary concern to exposing pets to children is
                        cleanliness. We
                        recommend children less than 18 months be kept away from pets because their immune systems
                        aren’t
                        stabilized or mature. When allowing a child less than 5 years old to pet or touch a reptile,
                        wash
                        the child’s hands before and after to prevent the risk of bacteria affecting the child. As it so
                        happens, poultry and poultry products are much more of a concern than a reptile, but caution
                        should
                        still be exercised.

                    <p>Squirrels are often found injured in the wild. Baby squirrels are prone to injury in particular.
                        If you need to care for a wild squirrel, you need to make sure he has proper food, shelter, and
                        veterinary care. Try to get your squirrel to a wildlife rescue as soon as you can. Keeping wild
                        squirrels as pets is not recommended as they do not do well in captivity and it is illegal in
                        most areas. Check the laws in your area before you do anything.

                        If you find a wild squirrel injured outside and it is legal for you to help the squirrel, then
                        make sure to provide him with a proper shelter. Wild squirrels do not carry rabies as a rule,
                        but it is possible for any warm-blooded animal to be infected so be careful. If you are bitten,
                        clean the wound out with some water and call your doctor for further treatment. Having the
                        squirrel tested for diseases will result in the squirrel's death. However, if you don't have a
                        cage there are other options.
                        <ul>
                            <li> Injured squirrels found in the wild tend to be babies. They often fall from nests or
                                get lost
                                from their mothers. A baby squirrel can be comfortable housed in a small box, such as a
                                shoe
                                box. You should leave the shoebox outside, away from other predators, and keep it open.
                                This
                                way, if he's lost his mother will be able to find him and retrieve him. However, you can
                                keep
                                the shoebox in your garage or a closed off room in your home if leaving the squirrel
                                outdoors is
                                not an option.</li>
                            <li> If you intend the keep the squirrel long-term because a rehabber or wildlife rescue is
                                not an
                                option, you're going to need a lot of time and money. The first step is to get a cage.
                                Adult
                                squirrels need tall cages so they can move around and play. Baby squirrels need smaller
                                cages so
                                they don't climb and end up falling and hurting themselves. If you have an old cat cage
                                or pet
                                carrier, you could use this for a baby squirrel. If it's plastic, the squirrel will chew
                                through
                                it quickly. An old bird cage, at least 3 feet tall, might work very temporarily for an
                                adult
                                squirrel. You can also purchase animal cages of a variety of shapes and sizes at your
                                local pet
                                store. Critter/Ferret nations are recommended for the small bar spacings and size.</li>

                                mucous membranes. Many pet stores sell nest boxes for birds for relatively low prices.

                                However,
                                stay away from towels or other items made of terrycloth or something similar. Squirrels
                                can
                                easily get their claws stuck in such materials, leading to injury.

                        If you found an injured baby squirrel, he needs to stay warm in order to survive. Wrap a hot
                        water bottle or a heating pad in flannel or a similar material. Place it in the box or cage
                        where you're keeping the baby squirrel. Do not cover the squirrel in any fabrics and do not put

                                know how to
                                feed him properly. In the event you take him back home with you, you can learn how to
                                care for
                                the baby online at TheSquirrelBoard.com. </li>
                            <li> They do make specially designed food for squirrels. It can be tricky to find, however,
                                as it may
                                be sold at your local pet store. Some states do not allow people to keep squirrels as
                                pets. You
                                may be able to order squirrel food online, but it might take a few days. In the event
                                you cannot
                                get squirrel food quickly, TheSquirrelBoard.com has recipes to make temporary formula.

                    <p> Keep a bowl of water in your squirrels cage or enclosure. Squirrels need plenty of water for
                        their health and wellbeing. You can either leave water in a bowl or use a bottle, like you would
                        in a hamster cage. If you're getting a bottle, make sure you use a glass bottle. Some squirrels
                        chew through plastic.[11]
                        If you're giving water to a baby squirrel, make sure any bowls you use are not too big. You
                        would not want a baby squirrel to accidentally drown in his water bottle. You can place rocks or
                        marbles at the bottom and fill the bowl to just halfway up to the marbles so he doesn’t drown.

                    <p> If you found a squirrel in the wild, he may be injured. You should carefully assess a squirrel
                        for injury and get him veterinary care if you see any injuries.
                        <ul>
                            <li> Find a safe spot in your home with good lighting. Stay away from children or other
                                pets. Wear
                                heavy, protective gloves when handling a wild animal. You should also wear a long sleeve
                                coat.
                                If a squirrel has not been handled before, he may bite or scratch. Squirrels are cleaner
                                than
                                most other animals. Just rinse out the cut and go about your business. </li>
                            <li> Keep a basin of warm water and a few clean washcloths on hand. Check the face, nose,
                                and mouth
                                for dried blood. If you see any parasites, like fleas or ticks, remove them. Parasites
                                should be
                                killed if still alive to avoid infecting other pets in your home. If you need to wash
                                any blood,
                                wring out the rag thoroughly and move it gently over the squirrel's fur.</li>
                            <li> Pay attention to your squirrel's limbs. Lets and feet may be twisted awkwardly or limp.

                                squirrels are especially prone to injury from falling out of a tree or nest.
                                If your squirrel is injured, contact a wildlife rehabber and/or vet IMMEDIATELY.</li>

                    <p>Squirrels need a lot of exercise. If you plan to keep your squirrel for awhile, you need to make
                        sure he spends time building his muscles.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Allow your squirrel access to one room of your house for at least an hour a day. Make
                                sure you
                                remove anything breakable or anything you do not want damaged. Allow your squirrels to
                                run,
                                climb, and play in this room.</li>
                            <li> Do not allow the squirrel outside without a cage. Hawks and other predators are faster
                                than you
                                and can make a meal out of the baby before you can react. Also, the baby may get spooked
                                and run
                                away, to never return, and thus die due to not knowing how to fend for himself.</li>
                            <li>If you're keeping your squirrel longer than a week or so, install some perches in his
                                cage. As
                                stated earlier, bird perches work well for a squirrel cage. They should come with
                                manufacturer's
                                instructions for set up.</li>
